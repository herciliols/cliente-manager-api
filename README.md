# Client Manager App ðŸš€

Welcome to the Client Manager App! This is a backend developed in Express.js for a client management application.

## Description

The Client Manager App is a Node.js application that provides a basic structure for managing clients. It uses the Express.js framework to create routes and interact with a MySQL database. User authentication is implemented with the generation of JWT tokens to secure sensitive routes.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/herciliols/cliente-manager-app.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd cliente-manager-app
    npm install
    ```

3. **Import the database dump:**

    Make sure you have the database dump located at `.db/u331719236_clientesdb.sql`. Import it into your MySQL database.

    DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    DB_DATABASE=your_mysql_database
    ```

    The server will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
